        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350 &#176;F or 176.75 &#8451 .</li>
            <li> <strong> make the Crust:</strong> using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs, pour into a medium bowl and stir in suger and melted butter until combined. ( you can alse pulse it all togather in a food processor.) mixture will be sanday. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. no nned to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly. pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminium foil. The fiol will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.</li>
            <li> <strong> Make the filling:</strong> Using a handled or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachement, beat the cream cheese and granulated suger togather on a medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smoth and creamy, about 12 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice the beat until fully combined. on medium speed, add the eggs ant at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To to help prevent the cheesecake from dafleting and cracking as it colls, avoid over-mixing the batter as best as you can. </li>
            <li> <strong> Prepare the simple water bath ( see notes):</strong> Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminium foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of crust. Use a rubber spatula or a spoon to smooth it into even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is the easier for you.) </li>
            <li> Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When its done, the center of the cheesecake wil slightly wobble if gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly. Let the chssesecake sit in the oven in the bath water as it cools downfor 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, the cool the chessecake completely at a room tempalature. then refrigerate the chessecake for atleast 4 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li> Use the knife to loosen the the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. for neat slices, wipe the knife clean and deep into warm water between each slice.</li>
            <li> Serve cheesecake with desired toppings in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
